# GO

Multi-Core oncurrency Support
Built-in concurrency mechanism

C++/Java
- Complex code
- Expensive & Slow


- Go was designed to run on multiple cores and 
built to support concurrency
- Concurrency in Go is cheap and easy

# Main Use Case of Go

- For Performant Applications
- Running on scaled, distribuited systems (cloud plataform)

# Characterstics of Go

## Attempt to ombine both:
  1 - Simple and readable syntax of a dynamically typed language like PYTHON
  2 - Efficiency and safety of a lower-level, statically typed language like C++

Simple Syntax: Easy to learn, read and write code

Language features left out on purpose for simplicity
(Goal: easy to maintain over time)

Fast build time, start up and run

Requires fewer resources

Compiled Language
  Go code is transformed into machine code by a compiler before it can run on a computer


# Download

- GoLand (IDE)
- SDK (Software Development Kit) - Most recent version

# Structure

main.go -> entry point of the program
  GOROOT
  GOPATH

shuould have main function to run, the same of the java  

# Go command
- go run main.go
